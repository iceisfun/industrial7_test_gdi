# data/win10/ui_metrics_ss6

Same source as ui_metrics, linked with subsystem version 6.0 (`-DUM_SS6`).
File: `dpi96.rec.gz` (13036 lines). Boots: quick 1, full 2. Determinism: IDENTICAL except sm/sm_dpi idx=93 (volatile undocumented metric, same as ui_metrics).

Environment (FACT, ENV rows): Windows 10 Home 22H2, 10.0.19045 UBR 2965 (buildlab 19041.1.amd64fre.vb_release.191206-1406), computer I7-WIN10,
user `Administrator`, session 1, elevated=1 (the auto-logon account is an elevated administrator, NOT a standard user), en-US (LCID 0x0409, ACP 1252,
OEMCP 437), 1024x768x32@64 Hz, one monitor, std VGA (Microsoft Basic Display Adapter), qemu/KVM `-cpu host -smp 2` (2 vCPU), 4 GiB. No comctl32 v6 manifest
for the base exe (comctl32 5.82.10586); the `v6` exe loads 6.16.10586. Produced by `tools/vm_run.sh` (docs/VM_RUN.md); provenance logs in `data/win10/_runs/`.
Determinism = a second fresh boot of the same exe at DPI 96, `python3 tools/rec.py diff A B` (the second recording is not stored).
